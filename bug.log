Description:
    When traversing the image sideways, the picture started tearing and copying the wrong side of the image 
    (when traversing left, strips of the right side of the image would show up and vice versa)
Solution:
    I realized for p_off, I was using show_x like in draw horizontal line, but show_x is not being updated,
    x is being updated in draw_vert_line, thus when I changed it to x, the picture traversed smoothly

Description:
    My room name was replaced by my text, and the input text was centered
Solution:
    My logic had a case to remove text if it overlapped, which shouldn't be an issue if you positioned the text right, but I did not,
    however I fixed the offset of the text and removed the logic.
